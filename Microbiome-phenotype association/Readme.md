# Microbiome-phenotype association

We evaluated associations between gut microbiome and phenotypes using linear mixed model.

Species abundance ~ age + sex + BMI + batch effect + bristol stool scale + DNA concentration + Sampling date + 1|village + phenotype

where the relative abundance of species was transformed using the centred additive log-ratio (CLR) transformation.
