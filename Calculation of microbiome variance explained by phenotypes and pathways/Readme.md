# Calculation of microbiome variance explained by phenotypes and pathways

The microbiome composition variance explained by phenotypes was calculated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices, implemented in the adonis function for R package vegan (v.2.6), using 1000 permutations and a Bray-Curtis distance matrix calculated using relative abundances of microbial species. Variance explained was also performed using relative abundances of MetaCyc microbial biochemical pathways separately.
