## Supplemntary data tables

This folder contains data tables in the supplementary section of the manuscript.

### Supplementary table 1

Association values of gut microbiome species (639) and phenotypes (123), with effect sizes and p-values, and p-adjusted (adjusted using FDR).

### Supplementary table 2

Association values of metabolic (567) and phenotypes (123), with effect sizes and p-values, and p-adjusted (adjusted using FDR).

### Supplementary table 3

Distribution of raw data across male and female samples for health phenotypes.

### Supplementary table 4

Distribution of raw data across male and female samples for food & animal phenotypes.

### Supplementary table 5

Distribution of raw data across male and female samples for socioeconomic phenotypes.

### Supplementary table 6

Association values of gut microbiome species (639) and unhealth ranges of physiological variables (15), with effect sizes and p-values (adjusted using FDR).

### Supplementary table 7

Breakdown of variance explained values for all phenotypic sub-categories for gut microbiome species and metabolic pathways.

### Supplementary table 8

Association effect sizes and p-ajusted values (adjusted using FDR) between species (70) and phenotypes (16) across both Honduran and Dutch Lifelines cohort. Only species and phenotypes common to both datasets are provided.

### Supplementary table 9

Association values (before and after including strain effect (from ALMER model) ) of gut microbiome species (639) and phenotypes (123), with effect sizes and p-values (adjusted using FDR).

### Supplementary table 10

Association values between polymorphic sites for each species (639) and phenotype (123), with effect sizes, p-values, and p-adjusted (adjusted using FDR).
